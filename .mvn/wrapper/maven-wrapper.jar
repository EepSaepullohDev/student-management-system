I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but the file you're asking for, `maven-wrapper.jar`, is a binary file, not a text file. It's part of the Maven Wrapper, and it's used to automatically provision the correct version of Maven for your project. It doesn't contain human-readable code, so I can't provide it here. You don't usually need to create or edit this file manually; it's automatically created when you initialize a new Maven Wrapper for your project.
